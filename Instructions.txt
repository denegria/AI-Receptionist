DOCUMENT 2: Step-by-Step Instructions for a Junior Developer

This is written as guidance, not code-level instructions.

Phase 1: Understand the Problem (Before Writing Code)

Clearly understand what the AI should and should not do.

Write down:

What happens when a call comes in?

What is the happy path (successful booking)?

What are failure paths (AI doesn’t understand, no availability)?

Diagram the call flow on paper or a whiteboard.

Phase 2: Set Up the Project Foundation

Choose a backend stack (Node.js or Python recommended).

Set up:

Version control (Git)

Basic project structure

Environment variables for API keys

Choose voice providers:

Speech-to-Text

Text-to-Speech

Confirm Google/Microsoft API access and documentation.

Phase 3: Build the Call Intake Flow

Make the system answer a call.

Play a greeting message.

Capture caller speech and convert it to text.

Log the raw transcript for debugging.

Return a basic AI response (even a hardcoded one at first).

Goal: A call can be answered and responded to.

Phase 4: Implement Intent Detection

Define core intents:

Book appointment

Reschedule

Cancel

For each intent, define:

Required information

Optional information

Test intent detection using sample call transcripts.

Goal: The system knows what the caller wants.

Phase 5: Build Scheduling Logic (Mock/Cache First)

Mock availability data (fake calendar).

Implement logic to:

Check availability

Offer alternatives

Confirm time slots

Handle edge cases:

No availability

Caller gives vague times (“next week”)

Goal: Scheduling logic works independently.

Phase 6: Integrate Calendar APIs (Google/Outlook)

Connect to Google Calendar / Microsoft Graph API.

Replace mocked data with real availability from cached calendar events.

Create real events in the calendar.

Sync local appointment cache.

Verify bookings appear on your real calendar.

Goal: Real appointments are created reliably.

Phase 7: After-Hours & Routing Logic

Implement time-based rules:

Compare current time vs business hours.

Decide:

Should AI answer this call?

Should it route elsewhere?

Add fallback handling:

Voicemail

Callback request

Goal: AI activates only when it should.

Phase 8: Admin Controls (Lightweight)

Create basic UI or config file for:

Business hours

Appointment rules

Ensure changes apply without redeploying code.

Phase 9: Testing & Iteration

Test with real phone calls.

Log failures and misunderstandings.

Improve prompts and clarifying questions.

Stress test with multiple calls.

Phase 10: MVP Definition Check

Before calling it “done,” confirm:

Calls are answered after hours

Appointments are booked correctly

Humans are not replaced

System fails gracefully
